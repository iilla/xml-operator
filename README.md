# XML Operator 

**XML Operator** is a **lightweight web application** that allows users to visually and interactively edit previously uploaded XML files. It is a simple yet powerful tool, ideal for modifying XML nodes 
and attributes without relying on a plain text editor.

> 📌 The project is currently in an early development stage, so some features or visual effects may be limited.

## 🌟 Project Overview

XML Operator is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** designed to make direct XML editing easier. With this tool, you can:

- 📄 **Upload XML files**
- ✏️ **Insert new nodes or attributes**
- 🗑️ **Edit or delete existing nodes/attributes**
- 🔁 **Visually explore the XML structure**

- No local software installation is required — it runs directly in your web browser.

## 🚀 Usage

- Open the application in your browser.
- Upload an .xml file from your system to the **include** folder.
- Browse the XML structure on screen. 
- Click on nodes or attributes to edit them.
- Use the available actions to insert, modify, or delete XML elements.
- Save or download the resulting XML file.

### 🧾 Requirements

- A web server with PHP support (Apache, Nginx, or PHP built-in server)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
  
## 📝 Notes

This project development was actually stopped in an early development phase. Some features or visual elements may still be incomplete or subject to change. The code is open to inspection, edition and reusability. I hope you find it useful!
